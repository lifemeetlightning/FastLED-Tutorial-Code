# FastLED Tutorial Code

This project contains some easy example code from my FastLED tutorial YouTube video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXi1491et8

## Overview

Two examples shown in the tutorial video: "Example 1 - Swirly, Twirly Colors" and "Example 2 - Breathing Effect"

## Features

- The Swirly, Twirly Colors example lights the LED's on the light strip from beginning to end then back to the beginning repeating and gradually changing colors.
- The Breathing Effect example lights up all the LED's at once slowly increasing then decreasing brightness, then changing colors when brightness is all the way down.
